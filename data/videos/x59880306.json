    "description": "Power Stop 1-Click Extreme Truck & Tow Brake Kits offer superior stopping power that is demanded by those that Tow\/Haul, as well as the off-road enthusiast. Any time you add weight to a vehicle by hauling a load, towing a trailer, or simply adding a larger wheel\/tire combination, you change the operating conditions of your stock brake package. Those operating conditions may exceed the ability of the stock braking components. Power Stop Z36 Truck & Tow Brake Kits are specifically matched components designed to produce the brake torque that is needed due to the increase in wheel diameter or load. The Drilled & Slotted rotors will reduce the heat and the Z36 Extreme Truck & Tow brake pads will provide the extra stopping power to bring your hauler to a halt quickly.",
