    "description": "Get a behind-the-scenes look at race day with the Beal Racing AutoAnything Nitro Funny Car Team. This year\u2019s car has been completely overhauled to prepare for the 2016 competition debut in Norwalk, OH so we took the opportunity to let it loose in Barona and give it a good test run. After waiting almost an hour with the outside temp dropping 10-15 degrees, the denser air caused the team\u2019s tune-up to be just a bit too aggressive. Stay tuned for more fast and loud videos featuring San Diego's fastest race car.",
