    "description": "Every time you head out for a drive, there is a risk that road or track debris will chip your paint. Should this affect the frequency and intensity with which you drive? We don't think so. This week on DRIVE CLEAN, we teach you the basic techniques for paint chip repair. While the chips are aesthetically painful, what's even more painful is the rust that will form from leaving them uncovered. With patience and proper application the results of your correction can be surprising. Most importantly, the substrate is once again protected from oxidization.",
