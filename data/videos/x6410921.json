The key here is hooking these lights to a readily available 12 volt power source and in most cases, this will be your truck's taillight harness. Once connected, you can stick the LED lights to the inside of your bed using the sturdy, 3M tape that's attached to their backs. And just like that, you have plenty of light to illuminate even the darkest beds.   \n\nSee more by accessories from Access here: http:\/\/www.autoanything.com\/brands\/102A298.aspx\n\nShop our entire selection of LED tonneau cover lighting here: http:\/\/www.autoanything.com\/shop\/tonneau-light",
