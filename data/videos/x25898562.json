    "title": "Clay: The Best Tool in Your Garage! - \/DRIVE CLEAN",
    "description": "Detailing clay was first use in the mid-80's in Japan and not introduced to the US until early 90's. Japanese body shops found that a mixture of various \"sticky\" resins would remove the over-spray from the surface of the paint without the use of compound or aggressive chemicals. Since then, clay has progressed into a more durable, softer, and safer product that will remove contaminants from the surface of the clear coats. Over-spray, tree sap, road gunk, brake dust, industrial fallout, etc...will embed itself into the paint, causing it to feel rough or \"bumpy\". These contaminates are sitting on top of the paint and can safely be removed with the use of clay. However, clay will not remove scratches because scratches are IN the paint....not ON the paint. Although being very easy to use, clay can damage your paint if re-used after it falls on the ground. Check out the video for do's an dont's of claying, and why I consider it the best tool in my garage.",
