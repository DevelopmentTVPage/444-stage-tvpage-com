        "description": "ARIES grille guards are built to work as hard as you do every time they climb into that truck for another 4-wheel-drive kind of day. Not only are our grille guards designed to give you a tough, trail-ready look for their truck or SUV, but they also provide front end protection and a great avenue for customization.\n\nARIES grille guards are constructed with a one-piece, heavy-duty, 1 1\/2\" steel tube design, and each one is made vehicle-specific for easier installation and a custom fit. Our Pro Series grille guards offer maximum customization with a patent-pending light bar housing and interchangeable cover plate. The Pro Series is available in a textured black carbon steel, while our standard ARIES Bar grille guards come in polished 304 stainless steel or semi-gloss black carbon steel.\n\nRegardless of the terrain they choose, dare your customers\nto conquer it with an ARIES grille guard.",
