    "description": "Owner:\n\u2022 Joe Massucco Jr.\n\nThis is a 1966 Dodge Coronet 440, and it's as stock as they come. We're talking drum brakes, 14-inch steel wheels with bias ply tires and a bench seat that was made for drive-in movies. I found this beauty at a local car show and instantly fell in love with it, because it reminded me of an old moonshine or getaway car that you'd see in any number of b-movies made in the 1970's. This car is a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and hot damn if it wasn't exactly what we ordered.",
