    "description": "Leo Parente and ShakeDown decide the holidays are the best time for a fight [you know what happens when you go home]. So, let's discuss which country is most important to racing. Let's leave the definition pretty broad. Not limiting your criteria to most wins, best drivers, or most racecars.
