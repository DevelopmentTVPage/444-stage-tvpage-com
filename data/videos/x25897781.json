Catch up on Season 2, as we lead up to the premiere of Season 3 on May 20!\n\nSeason 2  kicks off with a frigid bang as Team Subaru attacks the event known as Sn* Drift 2014.\n\n\"You only truly know how to accomplish something once you have actually done it. Turning points and opportunities are only fully recognized with hindsight.\n\nSo, for a team as experienced as Subaru Rally Team USA, reverse engineering a championship title should be straight forward. Except it never is.\n\nThousands of circumstances and decisions led to this moment, and no two seasons will offer the same opportunities. Experience might form the road map to a title, but it's a road map already out of date. The 2014 championships bring new competition, new events, and new cars. A new road awaits.\n\nThis is Season Two of Launch Control.\" - Subaru's Launch Control Page",
