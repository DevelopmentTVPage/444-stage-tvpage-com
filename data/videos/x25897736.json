    "description": "SPONSORED CONTENT: The high altitude plains of Northern Arizona aren't frequently driven, but the roads are perfect for Alex Roy and Mike Spinelli in the new Mercedes-Benz AMG GT S. In this episode, the two drive across the northern ridge of the Grand Canyon, journey through Zion National Park, and end up in the wilds of Western Utah. With its new 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine and a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission that delivers a 0-to-60 time of 3.7 seconds, the Mercedes-Benz AMG GT S is the perfect car to test the limits of these famed driving roads.",
