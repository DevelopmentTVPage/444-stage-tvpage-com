    "description": "Scratches and swirls are most commonly caused by improper car washing and care. When contaminants are not properly lifted away, they act as little grains of sandpaper. As you drag them across the paint, they leave behind very fine \"love marks\". This week on DRIVE CLEAN, we demonstrate how a dual action polisher, cutting pad, and compound or polish, can help you correct these fine scratches. Using the right combination of tools will allow you to re-level the paint and eliminate any visual defects; leaving a finish that is smooth as glass.",
