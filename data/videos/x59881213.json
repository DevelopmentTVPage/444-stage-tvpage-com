    "description": "This video features a walkthrough of how to install a set of Spyder Auto projector headlights with LED daytime running lights (DRLs) for Mark VI Volkswagen Golf, GTI and TDI models NOT equipped with OEM High Intensity Discharge headlights. This video will guide you through the process of removing the front bumper fascia and grille to install the headlights and offers other helpful tips throughout to facilitate a successful installation.\n\nNotes:\nThese headlights are designed for use with halogen-type bulbs and are not approved for street use with HID conversions. While HID conversion kits will probably fit and function, use of HID bulbs in housings not designed for HIDs will void your warranty -- consider a set of high quality, high lumen-output halogen bulbs as an alternative to HIDs for maximum light output.",
