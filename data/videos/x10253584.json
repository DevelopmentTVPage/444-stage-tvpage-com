    "description": "Features:\nFor owners of late model Ford F150 V8 trucks, Flowmaster announces the availability of the new American Thunder bolt-on exhaust system, part number 817522. Engineered for the 2009-2014 V8-powered F150, this 50-state emissions legal system fits all wheelbases and provides a deep, moderate performance tone outside, with a moderate tone inside the truck. Using a Super 40 Series muffler, along with mandrel-bent 2.50\" tailpipes, this system gives the truck the performance and mileage gains you expect from Flowmaster, while the optional out-the-sides or out-the-rear tailpipes allow the owner to tailor the look, with polished, Flowmaster-embossed stainless tips finishing things off.\nWith the included hardware and detailed instructions, this system is easily installed at home or by a professional, and a Limited Lifetime Warranty provides assurance that this will be the last exhaust your Ford will ever need.",
