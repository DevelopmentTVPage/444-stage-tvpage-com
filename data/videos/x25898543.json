    "description": "This week on DRIVE CLEAN, we take a tour of BMW's North American Headquarters in Woodcliff Lake New Jersey to discuss their \"Frozen\" matte paint and to identity how it differs from traditional clear-coat finishes. Matthew Russell, president of the M-car and Alpina division's for north America, gives us a tour of the facility and discusses how BMW came to create their new \"Frozen\" paint scheme (shown on BMW's M3 with Frozen Monte Carlo Blue). BMW's head of body-and-paint technical training manager, Walter Malec, also discusses matte-paint technology and repairs. And as expected, we'll also review how to best clean and care for matte finishes.",
