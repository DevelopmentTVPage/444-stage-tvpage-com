    "description": "Paint correction is one of the most difficult\u2014and most satisfying\u2014detailing skills to master. In this episode, we show how to restore paint that's been damaged as a result of poor washing habits. The techniques we review can be performed by anyone with a dual-action polisher and microfiber-cutting pad (as microfiber pads are extremely safe, even for novice detailers). We also review scratches on the microscopic level and illustrate how abrasives work to remove or diminish paint scratches and imperfections.",
