    "description": "This video features a walkthrough of how to install a set of Spyder Auto LED tail lights for Mark VI Volkswagen Golf, GTI and TDI  inspired by the styling cues of the latest Audi and VW models. This video will guide you through the process of how to install the both the inner and outer tail lights and offers other helpful tips throughout to facilitate a successful installation.\n\nNotes:\nOur test car here had its VAGCOM system (which controls the tail lights) reprogrammed for a set of EU-spec tail lights, which we were unable to reprogram to have the lights illuminate correctly, however, if your Golf has stock US-spec VAGCOM tail light settings, your tail lights will illuminate correctly.",
