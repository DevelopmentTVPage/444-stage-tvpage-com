We want to empower our fellow enthusiasts to know more, and do more, by learning from some of the best engineers in the game. \n\nThis week we went to BANKS Engineering to learn from the master of boost, Gale Banks, about why turbos are the best way to get power from an engine. He's done it all, from setting Bonneville records to building 1,400HP jet boats, to military drive trains. If you're thinking about building a turbo setup, or just want to know why they work, this episode is for you.",
